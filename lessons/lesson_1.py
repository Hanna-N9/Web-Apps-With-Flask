# Reference from the video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOHsHaaJ8VQ based on Decorators in Python

# Decorators allow programmers to wrap a function or method with additional functionality without altering its source code. 
# Decorators are special functions which can be used to return functionality to function. 
# Decorators can be applied using the @ symbol followed by the decorator name before the function definition. 
# This is to make code cleaner and readable.

# All functions are objects
