# Web-Apps-With-Flask
This repository contains my solutions and projects developed during the "Build Python Web Apps with Flask" path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/build-python-web-apps-flask). This path aims to gain hands-on experience in creating dynamic web applications using Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
