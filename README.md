# Web-Apps-With-Flask
This repository contains my solutions and projects developed during the "Build Python Web Apps with Flask" path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/build-python-web-apps-flask). This path aims to gain hands-on experience in creating dynamic web applications using Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- `lessons`: Each course lesson includes exercises and solutions.
- `projects`: Each project contains web applications built as part of the course to demonstrate the practical application of Flask and Python web development concepts. 

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the cloned directory
